        <p>Suppose that you're working in a small town administration, and you're in charge of two town elements:<br>
            1. Parks<br>
            2. Streets<br>
            <br>
            It's a very small town, so right now there are only 3 parks and 4 streets. All parks and streets have a name and a build year.<br>
            <br>
            At an end-of-year meeting, your boss wants a final report with the following:<br>
            1. Tree density of each park in the town (forumla: number of trees/park area)<br>
            2. Average age of each town's park (forumla: sum of all ages/number of parks)<br>
            3. The name of the park that has more than 1000 trees<br>
            4. Total and average length of the town's streets<br>
            5. Size classification of all streets: tiny/small/normal/big/huge. If the size is unknown, the default is normal<br>
            <br>
            All the report data should be printed to the console.<br>
            <br>
            HINT: Use some of the ES6 features: classes, subclasses, template strings, default parameters, maps, arrow functions, destructuring, etc.<br></p></div>
